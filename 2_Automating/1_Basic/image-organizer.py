Desc: Create a script that organizes your image files into folders by the date they were taken, extracting the date from the file metadata.

* User Input for Directory Selection: 
  - Prompt the user to input the path of the directory containing the images or give default path when press enter
  - Ask for for path where to move the files or set default as where image are located
  - Before starting the organization process, ask the user to confirm the action (e.g., "Do you want to organize the images in the directory 'path/to/directory'? (yes/no)").
* Display Progress: As you process each image, display the progress in the terminal (e.g., "Processing image 1 of 100...").
* Error Handling: Handle common errors and inform the user (e.g., "Error: No images found in the specified directory").
