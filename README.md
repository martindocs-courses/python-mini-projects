# Python Mini Projects

Welcome to the Python Mini Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small Python projects, each with a fun twist, organized into different levels of complexity.

This repository serves as a learning tool for my journey with Python. The projects range from simple scripts to more complex applications, allowing for progressive improvement in coding skills while keeping the learning process enjoyable.

## Folder Structure

The repository is organized into the following top-level folders:

- **1_Terminal**: Projects that run in the command line interface (CLI) and include basic scripts and tools.
- **2_Automation**: Projects focused on automating repetitive tasks and processes.
- **3_DataProcessing**: Projects dealing with data manipulation, analysis, and visualization.
- **4_Games**: Simple to complex games created using Python.
- **5_WebApp**: Projects related to web development, including web applications and APIs.
- **6_MobileApp**: Projects for mobile application development using frameworks like Kivy or BeeWare.
